This is the plan:

#1 goal: keep it simple and modular

  maybe: separate 2 services into separate repos

Prereqs: admin would have to install all 2 services and correctly configure
         all MagicMirror modules correctly

   note: this is not meant to replace the admin but it does accomplish 2 tasks
         1. allow user to connect raspberry pi to wifi if disconnected
            - example: if they move the mirror or change wifi password
         2. allow amdin to configure the existing mirror modules without having
            to ssh into the machine or give instructions to user on how to 
            solve it
            - Feature: allow the option for raw upload, where the admin can send
                       a config json file for the user to upload it
                       - the file could be emailed to the user and it would be
                         plug and play if tested by the admin properly

   note: updates should be done by the admin over ssh. This wont replace adding
         features to the mirror or system updates.
         - If changes, other than basic config changes, are to be made, 
           I recommend you make them on a dev board, test them on the dev board
           and then give the new micro sd card to the user

Have two separate services
1 a. Have script that check for wifi and internet connection
   every 1 minute
   - if not connected
     - spin down mm-config-service if its spun up
     - spin up wifi-config-service if its spun down
   - if connected
     - spin down wifi-config-service if its spun up
     - spin up mm-config-service if its spun down
   - maybe feature: allow multiple services to be run if connected to wifi
                    not just mm-config

1 b. wifi configuration setup
   - spins up access point to configure wifi
   - only available when not connected to any wifi
   - Steps:
     0. maybe: disable wifi checking script
     1. Wait for user to configure wifi (wait for POST request)
     2. Ask user for password
        a. If defaul passowrd ask user to change password
     3. Prompt user that the MagicMirror will restart and that mirror's wifi
        wont be there if wifi connection was successful and internet connection
        was established
     4. Allow user to select nearby wifi's and enter the passowrd
        a. would be cool if we could very wifi password with router directly
           so we don't have to restart the service
     2. Turn off access point
     4. Configure wifi with post request body contents
     5. Restart machine for access point to turn off 
   - Test: test if this works, not sure tbh

2. mm-config-api service
   - spins up when connected to wifi and iternet
   - allows user to configure the MagicMirror from a web browser
   - Steps:
     1. ask for password and authenticate
     2. spin up actual mm-config-api
   - Features that need to be implemented
     - ability to change default password
     - configure the default magic mirror config file
     - raw config upload
